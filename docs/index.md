**Orb** is a new kind of observability platform, fully [open source](http://orb.community) and backed by [NS1](https://ns1.com) that helps operators, developers, and end users understand their networks, distributed applications, and traffic flows in real time.

It combines concepts from Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Compute, and high throughput stream processing to offer command of a fleet of distributed agents which can be orchestrated in real time to summarize high volume, information dense data streams down to lightweight, actionable data sets directly at the edge.

**Orb** gives you a precision instrument to collect just the observability data you are interested in, extracting the needles from the haystack at the edge. It is based on
the [pktvisor](https://github.com/ns1/pktvisor) observability agent.

The platform is open source, extensible, vendor neutral, and cloud native.
