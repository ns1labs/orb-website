# Why Orb?

## Distributed Deep Network Observability
Orb manages a fleet of agents deployed across distributed, hybrid infrastructure: containers, VMs, servers, routers and switches. 
The agent taps into traffic streams and extracts real time insights, resulting in light-weight, actionable metrics.

## Streaming Analysis at the Edge
Based on the [pktvisor observability agent](https://pktvisor.dev), Orb's goal is to push analysis to the edge, where high resolution
data can be analysed in real time without sending it to a central location for batch processing.

## Realtime Agent Orchestration
agents connect out to control plane. iot tech. policies in real time.

## Flexible Integration With Modern Observability Stacks
prometheus first. collection included.

## Portal and REST API Included

## Open Source, Vendor Neutral, Cloud Native

# Backed by NS1
**Orb** was born at [NS1 Labs](https://ns1.com/labs), where we're
committed to making [open source, dynamic edge observability a reality](https://ns1.com/blog/orb-a-new-paradigm-for-dynamic-edge-observability).
